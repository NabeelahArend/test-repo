     INSPIRATION FROM WATERMELON
     </h1>
     <p class="p1">
      Without a reason, without motivation, nothing happens. If we don't know 'why' to do something, if we don't have a reason to do it, then we often don't do it. Why brush our teeth? Why save money instead of spending it all? Why study for the test? I am convinced that most people know 'what', they just don't know 'why'. Our inspiration can be emotional, it can be an internal standard of behavior or it can be a future goal we want to achieve, or, in a less mature way, it may be pleasure seeking. Once we find a valuable 'why', an inner hole is filled. When we don't have it, nothing will move us, and that's what we do. Nothing. What will motivate you into the action that brings about your desires? What will get you going? I don't know. I hope this helps.
